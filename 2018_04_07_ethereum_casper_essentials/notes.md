# NOTES

Ethereum Proof of Stake Essentials: An Overview of Casper

From [2]

- Two slashing conditions

- a correct-by-construction fork choice rule, use the longest justified chain, justified means that has 2/3 of the votes.

- dynamic validator sets

Casper It's a BFT (Byzantine fault tolerant)[1]

The two Casper Commandments

AN INDIVIDUAL VALIDATOR Î½ MUST NOT PUBLISH TWO DISTINCT VOTES, SUCH THAT EITHER

a validator must not publish two distinct votes for the same target height
Equivalently, a validator must not vote within the span of its other votes
